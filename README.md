It took me some time to do this, I really hope that you and your server enjoy it!
This addon is inspired by the Bank Robbery System from Script Fodder. However this code does not have any connections with it. It's made for free by me.

##### Quick Questions: #####

1.The Robbery fails imediataly after starting it!

You can't have two Banks on the same map. 

2.I tried the new system for setting up teams... It gave me errors!

Don't forget the quotes and the commas! Also put the exact same name that appears in*game. Ex: Mob boss = Mob Boss (WRONG!) Lua is case sensitive.

3.The Config File is not working!

Restart your server and make sure that you saved the Config File.

4.I remember seeing this on CoderHire/Script Fodder...

I started this project wanting to clone the Bank Robbery System from Script Fodder, they both do the same but the code is all mine.
